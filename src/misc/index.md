# Miscellanea

This is a list of a bunch of projects and stuff that I've worked on. I'll try my best to categorize and chronologize but work is fickle and sporadic :)

Consider this a living document.

## Gamehacking

Professionally, I used to sell a custom client for Minecraft, and a subscription trainer menu for GTA Online.
In addition, I love modding Unity3D games. There's something about MSIL that activates the Java bytecode part of my brain.

Games are a really fun playground for me because there is a bunch of emergent behavior:
Here's a video demonstration of a fast infinite obsidian glitch in Minecraft, it's a limited instant block breaking exploit chained with a special world interaction.

## Linux on the desktop

Since 2012 I have ran Linux as a desktop operating system, though it is no longer my primary computing setup.

My first distro was Ubuntu 12.04, but I did a lot of hopping around (Linux Mint, Fedora, Crunchbang, etcetc) before settling on Arch Linux for a long while (2014 to 2019?).

Nowadays, I have home machines that run Arch Linux (both server and desktop), VPSes that run Alpine Linux, and desktops/laptops that run NixOS.

But my primary machine actually runs Windows 11 (Pro for Workstations) because it has HiDPI 4K screens and multiple GPUs and other hardware choices that make it more inconvenient to run desktop Linux.

I also love the Apple M-series chips, but it means maining anything other than a macOS machine as a laptop is a non-optimal choice.
So Linux has been relegated to auxiliary desktop + server computing for me now.

Here are some screenfetches (March 2024):
