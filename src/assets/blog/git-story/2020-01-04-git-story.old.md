# `git-story`: A webpage for detailed commit messages

Today, we want to generate a static site from commit messages in a Git repository.

In the end, we'll get something looking like this:

![An image of the final 'Git Story' webpage, showing some detailed commit messages](/assets/blog/git-story/end-result.png)

## The Tech

I already have a [static site generator, `side`](https://github.com/videogame-hacker/side); so I decided to use that. It's written in TypeScript and runs under `deno`, a very-new, very-immature node.js replacement. This is going to make things hard for us, but we'll get to that later.

Despite the problems, I think it's worth it since writing *real code* to write out your static site is way nicer than having to write a bunch of YAML files to configure an off-the-shelf SSG.
`side` doesn't *read* your build config, it *executes* it.

## The Motivation

Why do we want to show long commits on a webpage?

Commit messages help team members, or even future-you decipher the history of a piece of code via `git blame`. I think it's a good idea to encourage detailed commit messages; featuring detailed ones on a page is a good way to do this.

## The Vision

I wrote the 'Usage' section of the README before writing any code, it looks like this:

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/videogame-hacker/git-story.git"
$ cd git-story/
$
$ # Add some repositories:
$ ln -s path/to/my-project/.git repos/my-project
$ ln -s path/to/another-project/.git repos/another-project
$
$ side # Build the project
$ (cd build/ && python3 -m http.server) # Locally serve the built static-site.
```

We want to symlink in some `.git` folders, run `side`, and have a pretty-looking static site pop out the other end.

## Parsing the `.git` folder

Since we're in `deno`, we don't have any `libgit2` bindings, so we'll have to parse the `.git` folder manually.

First off, we're going to want to find out where the repositories are.

We can simply use Deno's `readDir` and see if a directory contains common git elements, and we use an async generator that uses some of `side`'s BuildContext functions to read the source directory and yield the repository names:

```typescript
async function* gitRepos(ctx) {
  for (const child of await Deno.readDir(ctx.sourceDir)) {
    try {
      const children = (await Deno.readDir(`${ctx.sourceDir}/${child.name}`))
        .map(info => info.name)
      
      if (!(children.includes("HEAD")
          && children.includes("objects")
          && children.includes("refs"))) {
        continue // Not a git repository, skip it.
      }
      
      yield child.name
    } catch (err) {
      // Not a directory, skip it.
    }
  }
}
```

Then, we can simply read where `HEAD` points to:

```typescript
async function getHeadObject(ctx, repo: string): Promise<string> {
  let headRef = (await ctx.readText(`${repo}/HEAD`)).trim()
  if (!headRef.startsWith("ref: "))
    return undefined
  
  headRef = headRef.substring("ref: ".length, headRef.length)
  return (await ctx.readText(`${repo}/${headRef}`)).trim()
}
```

### Parsing `.git/objects/`

Objects in the `.git` folder are stored as raw `zlib`-compressed data.

`deno` doesn't actually have any built-in ways to use `zlib`, and we're not going to be able to create bindings any time soon.

I found a JavaScript implementation of zlib's algorithms called [pako](https://nodeca.github.io/pako/), and it turns out that someone has already kindly [ported it to deno](https://github.com/arcatdmz/deno_std/tree/feat-archive-zip/archive/pako) in order to support the `.zip` file format. Great.

We can read an object really simply now, but take note that the filename are the first byte the hash, a directory separator, and the rest of the hash. (Where the hash is represented as a hex digest)

```typescript
import * as pako from "./build_src/vendor/pako/index.ts";

async function readObject(ctx, repo: string, object: string): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  const prefix = object.substring(0, 2)
  const suffix = object.substring(2, object.length)

  let data = await ctx.read(`${repo}/objects/${prefix}/${suffix}`)
  data = pako.inflate(data)
  
  return data
}
```

### Object headers in `.git`

In the decompressed object data, there are two header components: The object's type, and its size. The formula is `type <space> size (as ascii) <null byte>`; and we don't really care about validating the size, so we write a simple `parseObjectHeader` to consume the header, grab the type, and return the rest of the data:

```typescript
function parseObjectHeader(data: Uint8Array) {
  const typeSep = data.indexOf(0x20)
  const type = data.subarray(0, typeSep)
  const headerSep = typeSep + data.subarray(typeSep, data.length).indexOf(0x0)

  const contents = data.subarray(headerSep, data.length)
  return { type, contents }
}
```

### A commit object

Here's an example of what a whole commit object looks like, it's an excerpt from my Java obfuscator's git history:

```
commit 888
tree 36b2b07bd841e6e13d83f08471498ef118efbce1
parent 000578dcc1dd061f1d0a0d0b0d17716075b8956e

Fix crashes on specific systems with DisableBytecodeVerification

We were observing this behaviour on Oracle JRE-only 32-bit Windows
installations of Java 8, wherein the DisableBytecodeVerification class
was accessing non-paged memory, causing an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
fault.

We notice that every time the fault occurs, the accessed memory address
is located at 2^32, so we just co-opt the 'is zero' check to also check
for the other invalid value.

Hopefully, this will fix obfuscated applications for many end users.

As a temporary workaround, urge end users to install and use a
64-bit JDK edition of Java.
```

As you can see, there is a header with space-separated key-values, followed by a blank line, and then the raw commit message. This should be easy to parse:

```typescript
function parseCommitObject(commitData: Uint8Array) {
  const data: string = decodeUTF8(commitData)
  
  const commit = {
    message: ""
  }

  let isKeyValues = true
  for (const line of data.split("\n")) {
    if (isKeyValues && line.length === 0) {
      isKeyValues = false
      continue
    }

    if (isKeyValues) {
      const sep = line.indexOf(' ')
      const key = line.substring(0, sep)
      const value = line.substring(sep + 1, line.length)

      commit[key] = value
    } else {
      if (commit.message.length !== 0)
        commit.message += "\n"
      
      commit.message += line
    }
  }

  return commit
}
```

Then, since every commit has a `parent`, we can walk up the commit tree to get the full history of a project:

```typescript
async function walkCommitTree(ctx, repo, commit, commits = []) {
  commits.push(commit)

  const parentObject = commit.parent

  const parentObjectData = await readObject(ctx, repo, parentObject)
  const { type, contents } = parseObjectHeader(parentObjectData)
  if (decodeUTF8(type) === 'commit') {
    const parentCommit = parseCommitObject(side, contents)
    try {
      await walkCommitTree(side, ctx, repo, parentCommit, commits)
    } catch (err) {
      // We're done.
    }
  }

  return commits
}
```

```typescript
async function getCommits(ctx, repo) {
  const headObject = await getHeadObject(ctx, repo)
  const headObjectData = await readObject(ctx, repo, headObject)
  
  const { type, contents } = parseObjectHeader(headObjectData)
  if (decodeUTF8(type) === 'commit') {
    const headCommit = parseCommitObject(side, contents)
    const commits = walkCommitTree(ctx, repo, headCommit)

    return commits
  }

  return undefined
}
```

### Issue 2: `git` packfiles

Unfortunately, all this code we've written works fine for Git's loose object format, but the loose object format isn't the only one that Git uses: This means that we fail to resolve some parents since their object doesn't exist in the `.git/objects` folder, but rather inside a packfile.

Packfiles are such a complicated file format, [Write Yourself a Git](https://wyag.thb.lt/) skips over them entirely. In order to view the full history of a repo, though, I *will* have to unpack these somehow.

I actually got halfway through writing a packfile parser (I implemented [deltas](https://gist.github.com/videogame-hacker/0986190c94165d063d8c6f26e49d5223)) before giving up, and opting to spawn `git` command-line subprocesses instead.

---

**Lesson learned:** However inelegant a simple solution might be, it's probably not worth the headache to go the other way.

Oh, well. At least I learned a little about git internals.

## Parsing the `.git` folder, take two:

Okay, we can keep our `gitRepos` generator, but otherwise start from scratch. Our build script currently looks like this:

```typescript
async function* gitRepos(ctx) {
  /* ... */
}

export async function build(side, ctx) {
  for await (const repo of gitRepos(ctx)) {
    console.log(repo)
  }
}
```

### Spawning a subprocess

With Deno, this is pretty easy to do, so there's no real headache here. We just run `git log` inside the symlinked `.git` folder in the `src` directory. No problem.

```typescript
export async function build(side, ctx) {
  const { decodeUTF8 } = side;

  for await (const repo of gitRepos(ctx)) {
    const gitProcess = Deno.run({
      args: ["git", "log"],
      stdout: "piped",
      cwd: `${ctx.sourceDir}/${repo}`
    });

    const output = await gitProcess.output()
    console.log(decodeUTF8(output))
  }
}
```

This dumps a `git log` of every project into our console.

### Parsing the commits, take two:

The `git log` output is a bit different to the raw files, so we're going to have to look at the format again:

All the commits are in one stream, so we'll have to separate them as we parse, and commit messages are indented by four spaces.

    Fix crashes on specific systems with DisableBytecodeVerification

    We were observing this behaviour on Oracle JRE-only 32-bit Windows
    installations of Java 8, wherein the DisableBytecodeVerification class
    was accessing non-paged memory, causing an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
    fault.

    Hopefully, this will fix obfuscated applications for many end users.

    As a temporary workaround, urge end users to install and use a
    64-bit JDK edition of Java.
```

So we can write a really simple parser with two parsing modes: `HEADER`, and `MESSAGE`.

```typescript
function getCommits(output) {
  const commits = [];

  enum ParseMode { HEADER, MESSAGE };
  let mode = ParseMode.MESSAGE;
  let commit = null;

  for (const line of output.split("\n")) {
    if (mode === ParseMode.MESSAGE) {
      if (line.startsWith("    ")) {
        commit.raw_message += line.substring(/* ... */) + "\n";
      }

      if (line.startsWith("commit ")) {
        const commitHash = line.substring(/* ... */);

        if (commit) commits.push(commit);
        commit = { commitHash, raw_message: "" };
        mode = ParseMode.HEADER;
      }
    }

    if (mode === ParseMode.HEADER) {
      if (line.startsWith("Author: "))
        commit.author = line.substring(/* ... */);
      
      if (line.startsWith("Date: "))
        commit.date = new Date(line.substring(/* ... */));
      
      if (line.length === 0)
        mode = ParseMode.MESSAGE;
    }
  }

  if (commit) commits.push(commit);
  return commits;
}
```

We've populated a `raw_message`, but we want to separate it out into a 'header' and 'body', where the first line is the header for the commit:

```typescript
function parseCommitMessage(rawMessage) {
  const lines = rawMessage.split("\n");

  return {
    header: lines[0],
    body: lines.slice(1).join("\n")
  };
}
```

And transforming the list of commits to add this structure in is super simple. Also, we apply a threshold to the commit message length, so that only long messages get in:

```typescript
export function build(side, ctx) {
  let commits = [];

  for await (const repo of gitRepos(ctx)) {
    commits.push(...getCommits(decodeUTF8(output))
      .map(commit => ({
        message: parseCommitMessage(commit.raw_message),
        ...commit
      }))
      .filter(commit =>
        commit.message.body.length > 240)
    )
  }
}
```

Okay, cool, now we have all the commits we want in the right format, we write a `.tsx` template to render it to HTML:

```html
// side passes in a 'props' object,
// which includes a 'React.createElement' so that
// the TSX compiler doesn't get mad at us:

export default ({ commits, React }) =>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <title>Git Story</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>git story</h1>

      {commits.map(commit =>
        <article class="commit">
          <header>
            <p class="author">{commit.author}</p>
            <p class="date">{commit.date}</p>
          </header>

          <h2>{commit.message.header}</h2>
          <span class="body">{commit.message.body}</span>
        </article>
      )}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

And then hook the template up to our build script:

```typescript
import template from "./build_src/template.tsx";

export function build(side, ctx) {
  const { renderTemplate } = await side.ext.get("templating");
  let commits = [];

  /* ... */

  commits = commits.sort((a, b) => a.date > b.date ? -1 : 1)

  await ctx.writeText("index.html", 
      await renderTemplate(ctx, template, { commits }))
  await ctx.copy("styles.css")
}
```

And we're done. All that's left is to write a CSS file in the 'src' folder to style the site.

I went with something very simple:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: white;
}

main {
  max-width: 88ch;
  margin: 1em auto;
}

p {
  margin: 0;
}

.commit {
  background-color: aliceblue;
  padding: 1.25em;
  margin: -1em;
  border-radius: 6px;
}

.commit + .commit {
  margin-top: 3em;
}

.commit h2 {
  margin: 0;
}

.commit .body {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 2em;

  font-family: monospace;
  white-space: pre-wrap;
}
```

And we get our end result that you can see at the top of this page. [See the source here.](https://github.com/videogame-hacker/git-story)

## Conclusions

I imagine that, if implemented on a company intranet across all projects, it would lead to:

- Higher quality commit messages written with the aim of being featured on the team's 'Git Story'
- Better understanding of others' code, due to these messages providing more detailed explanations

Also, we've experimented a bit with `side` here, and managed to get a working site built with very little boilerplate code.
